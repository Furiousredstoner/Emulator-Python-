# Emulator-Python-
# First Version started in 4/15/2018
# The Emulator wasn't proper so I revamped it in 1/6/2019 (Yeah, a long ass time ... some of it was for the Emulator but most of the time was for other projects)
# I Started making the Emulator in Hex in 12/1/2019

# So when I first started coding the Emulator I was making it run ROMS via script .. Yeah not really how ROMS actually work.. so i learned how a CPU works in IRL computers as well as looking up how old Retro consoles worked.. and i saw that Hex code can be used for OPCODES ( Instruction/OPeration CODES) and IMMediate (which is just Data for the CPU) .. so i started implenting a Hex decoder and i first started with my own IS (Instruction Set) and i made the CPU decode the Hex OPCODES and make it run instructions to tell GPU to plot or tell CPU to store values in the REGisters

# Total time on this Project (4/15/2018 - 1/15/2020 or 1 year, 9 months, 1 day) , 2 years in and finally promising progress
